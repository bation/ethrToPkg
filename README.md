# Ethr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/ethr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Microsoft/ethr)

Ethr is a cross platform network performance measurement tool written in golang. The goal of this project is to provide a native tool for comprehensive network performance measurements of bandwidth, connections/s, packets/s, latency, loss & jitter, across multiple protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, and across multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux and other Unix systems.

</p>

Ethr takes inspiration from existing open source network performance tools and builds upon those ideas. For Bandwidth measurement, it is similar to iPerf3, for TCP & UDP traffic. iPerf3 has many more options for doing such as throttled testing, richer feature set, while Ethr has support for multiple threads, that allows it to scale to 1024 or even higher number of connections, multiple clients communication to a single server etc. For latency measurements, it is similar to latte on Windows or sockperf on Linux.

Ethr provides more test measurements as compared to other tools, e.g. it provides measurements for bandwidth, connections/s, packets/s, latency, and TCP connection setup latency, all in a single tool. In the future, there are plans to add more features (hoping for others to contribute) as well as more protocol support to make it a comprehensive tool for network performance measurements.

Ethr is natively cross platform, thanks to golang, as compared to compiling via an abstraction layer like cygwin that may limit functionality. It hopes to unify performance measurement by combining the functionality of tools like iPerf3, ntttcp, psping, sockperf, and latte and offering a single tool across multiple platforms and multiple protocols.

# Download

## Building from Source

We use go-module to manage Ethr dependencies. for more information please check [how to use go-modules!](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-to-use-modules)

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/ethr.git
cd ethr
go get ./...
go build
```

If Ethr is cloned inside of the `$GOPATH/src` tree, please make sure you invoke the `go` command with `GO111MODULE=on`!

## Docker

Build image using command: 
```
docker build -t microsoft/ethr .

```
# Publishing Nuget package
Follow the topic Building from Source to build ethr.exe

Modify ethr.nuspec to add new release version
```
vim ethr.nuspec
```
Create a nuget package(like Ethr.0.2.1.nupkg)
```
nuget.exe pack ethr.nuspec
```
Upload the package to nuget.org.

# Usage

## Simple Usage
Help:
```
ethr -h
```

Server:
```
ethr -s
```

Server with Text UI:
```
ethr -s -ui
```

Client:
```
ethr -c <server ip>
```

Examples:
```
// Start server
ethr -s

// Start client for default (bandwidth) test measurement using 1 thread
ethr -c localhost

// Start bandwidth test using 8 threads
ethr -c localhost -n 8

// Start connections/s test using 64 threads
ethr -c localhost -t c -n 64
```

## Complete Command Line
### Common Parameters
```
	-h

		Show output in text UI.
	-ports <k=v,...>
		Use custom port numbers instead of default ones.
		A comma separated list of key=value pair is used.
		Key specifies the protocol, and value specifies base port.
		Ports used for various tests are calculated from base port.
		Example: For TCP, Bw: 9999, CPS: 9998, PPS: 9997, Latency: 9996
		Control is used for control channel communication for ethr.
